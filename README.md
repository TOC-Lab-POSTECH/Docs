# About

At [Theory of Computation Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/discrete-algorithms-lab/) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/), we are dedicated to developing sublinear algorithmic frameworks based on mathematical analysis to efficiently process diverse large-scale data. In particular, this project focuses on designing algorithms that operate in sublinear time and space to handle point sets, time series, and graphs.

As technological advancements accelerate across various sectors of society and industry, the need for more flexible and efficient algorithms has become increasingly significant. In particular, the ability to process large-scale data in real time has become a critical requirement, necessitating novel approaches beyond conventional methodologies.

Classical algorithms typically assume that the entire dataset can be read sequentially and fully loaded into memoryâ€”a constraint that poses significant challenges in real-world large-data environments. To address these limitations, many existing open-source solutions rely on heuristic techniques, which often lack formal theoretical guarantees.

The framework introduced in this document is based on sublinear algorithmic models combined with rigorous mathematical analysis, aiming to ensure both theoretical soundness and practical usability. We hope to bridge the gap between provable efficiency and real-world applicability, so that this framework may contribute to domains such as recommender systems, financial fraud detection, and smart grid analytics.
